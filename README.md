# Polygons-to-Rectangles
In the 1990's I made a short C program to reduce the authenticity of polygons by turning them into rectangles, or something between, according to the chosen level of authenticity.  I got the idea when someone said that all scenes in flight simulators are too real-looking.  My cousin said that it is a pity that all ideas just stand on somebody's desk.  At that time there was no GitHub.  Now more than 20 years later I returned to this small software and made a VisualStudio project including C++ software and an initial UML chart.  The file Pgtortgl.c contains the original software.  Different methods for choosing main corners of the rectangles can be studied.  The project could also be extended so that corners could be moved in different ways.
